# References Folder

This folder is for **supporting material** that LLMs and humans can refer to while working
on **Dog Treat Tycoon / doggydogworld**.

Suggested contents:

- High-level design docs.
- System specs (architecture, game systems, UI/UX, events, monetization).
- Research notes and links.
- LLM session notes and logs.

By default, this pack includes:

- `LLM_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md` – a template you can copy/rename to `LLM_NOTES.md` and keep updated.

You can add more files here (e.g. `VISION_AND_GOALS.md`, `ART_DIRECTION.md`, etc.) and the
**Master Orchestrator** or other LLM roles should be instructed to read from this folder when possible.
